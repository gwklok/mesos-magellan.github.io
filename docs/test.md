## Unit Testing

### Scheduler

The scheduler has a suite of jUnit tests that are run on every push to GitHub and after building locally.

## Performance Testing

### Stress Test

Create many jobs over time

### Soak Test

Run a few long jobs

### Spike Test

Create many jobs at once

### Result and Time Comparisons

#### Distributed Simulated Annealing vs. Bruteforce

#### Distributed Simulated Annealing vs. Locally Serial

#### Distributed Simulated Annealing vs. Locally Parallel

## Accuracy Testing

Prove distributed simulated annealing works by comparing it to bruteforce results.
